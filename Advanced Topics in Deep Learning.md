## 1. Transfer Learning

- **Concept and Importance**
  - Definition: A technique where a model pre-trained on a large dataset is fine-tuned for a specific, often smaller, target task.
  - Benefits:
    - Reduces training time and computational costs.
    - Requires less labeled data for the target task.
    - Often achieves better performance by leveraging knowledge from the pre-trained task.

- **Popular Pre-Trained Models**
  - **AlexNet**:
    - Introduced in 2012 and known for its success in the ImageNet Challenge.
    - Features: Convolutional layers with ReLU activation, dropout for regularization.
    - Applications: Object detection and image classification.
  - **ResNet**:
    - Introduced the concept of residual connections to mitigate vanishing gradients.
    - Features: Depths ranging from 18 to 152 layers for various tasks.
    - Applications: Medical image analysis, autonomous driving.
  - **GoogLeNet (Inception Network)**:
    - Efficient architecture with inception modules for computational optimization.
    - Applications: Multi-object detection, real-time recognition systems.
