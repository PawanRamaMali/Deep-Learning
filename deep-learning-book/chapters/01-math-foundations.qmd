## Introduction to Mathematical Concepts

Deep learning relies heavily on mathematical structures to represent and process data. In this chapter, we'll explore the fundamental mathematical concepts needed for understanding deep learning algorithms.

## Scalars, Vectors, and Matrices

### Scalars
A scalar is a single numerical value. In deep learning, we often use scalars for:

- Learning rates
- Loss values
- Threshold values

### Vectors
Let's create and manipulate vectors in both Python and R:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python
```{python}
import numpy as np

# Create a vector
v = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print("Vector:", v)
print("Shape:", v.shape)
