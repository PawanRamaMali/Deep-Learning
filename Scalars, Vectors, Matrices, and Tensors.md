# Mathematical Foundations for Deep Learning

Deep learning relies heavily on mathematical structures to represent data and perform computations. Key foundational concepts include **scalars**, **vectors**, **matrices**, and **tensors**. These structures allow us to model, manipulate, and compute relationships in data efficiently.

## Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors

### 1. **Scalars**
A scalar is a single numerical value. It represents a quantity without direction. Scalars are often used to represent simple attributes, such as the learning rate in optimization or a loss value in training.

- **Notation:** Scalars are typically denoted by lowercase letters, such as \( s \), and belong to the set of real numbers (\( $\mathbb{R}$ \)).
- **Example:** 
  - Learning rate: \( $s = 0.01$ \)
  - Temperature: \( $s = 25 \, \mathrm{C}$ \)

---

### 2. **Vectors**
A vector is an ordered list of numbers that represents a quantity with both magnitude and direction. Vectors are widely used in machine learning to represent data points, features, or weights.

- **Notation:** Vectors are denoted by bold lowercase letters, such as \( $\mathbf{v}$ \). A vector with \( $n$ \) elements belongs to \( $\mathbb{R}^n$ \).
- **Mathematical Representation:**
  \[
  $\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{bmatrix}$
  \]
- **Example:**
  - Feature vector: \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 1.2 \\ 0.5 \\ 3.7 \end{bmatrix} \) (e.g., a set of attributes in a dataset).
  - Weight vector in a linear regression model: \( \mathbf{w} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.3 \\ -1.2 \\ 2.4 \end{bmatrix} \).

### 3. **Matrices**
A matrix is a 2D array of numbers, where data is organized into rows and columns. Matrices are essential in deep learning for operations like transformations, feature extraction, and representation of weights.

- **Notation:** Matrices are denoted by bold uppercase letters, such as \( \mathbf{M} \). An \( m \times n \) matrix belongs to \( \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \).
- **Mathematical Representation:**
  \[
  \mathbf{M} = \begin{bmatrix} 
  m_{11} & m_{12} & \cdots & m_{1n} \\ 
  m_{21} & m_{22} & \cdots & m_{2n} \\ 
  \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 
  m_{m1} & m_{m2} & \cdots & m_{mn} 
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- **Operations:**
  - Addition: \( \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B} \)
  - Scalar multiplication: \( \lambda \mathbf{M} \)
  - Matrix multiplication: \( \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} \)

- **Examples:**
  - Input batch: 
    \[
    \mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix} 
    1 & 2 \\ 
    3 & 4 
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]
    represents two data points with two features each.
  - Weight matrix for neural network layer:
    \[
    \mathbf{W} = \begin{bmatrix} 
    0.5 & -1.2 \\ 
    0.8 & 1.5 
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]

### 4. **Tensors**
Tensors generalize scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher dimensions. They are critical in deep learning for storing multi-dimensional data, such as images, videos, or language models.

- **Notation:** Tensors are denoted by bold calligraphic letters or symbols like \( \mathcal{T} \). A tensor of rank \( n \) belongs to \( \mathbb{R}^{d_1 \times d_2 \times \cdots \times d_n} \).
- **Examples:**
  - A scalar is a 0-dimensional tensor.
  - A vector is a 1-dimensional tensor.
  - A matrix is a 2-dimensional tensor.
  - A 3-dimensional tensor could represent a color image:
    \[
    \mathcal{T} = \text{[Width, Height, Channels]}
    \]
    Example dimensions: \( 256 \times 256 \times 3 \), where the three channels are Red, Green, and Blue.

- **Real-world Examples:**
  - Image batch in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
    \[
    \mathcal{T} = \mathbb{R}^{N \times H \times W \times C}
    \]
    where \( N \) = number of images, \( H \) = height, \( W \) = width, \( C \) = channels.
  - Sequence data in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):
    \[
    \mathcal{T} = \mathbb{R}^{N \times T \times F}
    \]
    where \( N \) = batch size, \( T \) = sequence length, \( F \) = features per time step.
